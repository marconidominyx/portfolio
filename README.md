# portfolio

A quiet space for the work I'm building, the systems I care about, and the small projects that keep me moving forward.

## what's here

This is my personal portfolio. A simple collection of things I've made, thoughts I've shared, and work I'm proud of.

You'll find:

- A WEB3 profile page (`index.html`) — my Web3 community builder profile
- A personal portfolio page (`portfolio/portfolio.html`) — a deeper look at my work and projects
- A few projects I've built
- My resume, if you're curious
- Ways to reach me, if you'd like to connect

## how to view

If you'd like to see it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marconidominyx/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
```

Then open `index.html` in your browser. That's it.

## please hire me (seriously)

I'm open to any kind of work, collaboration, or wild ideas you might have. I'm an all-around person - I'll learn what I need to learn, figure things out as I go, and do my best to make things work.

Why? Because I'm trying to provide for the people I love, and honestly, I just enjoy building things. Plus, I make a mean cup of coffee and I'm pretty good at responding to emails (most of the time).

So if you have something that needs doing, a project that needs building, or just want to collaborate on something cool — let's talk. I'm here, I'm ready, and I'm probably already googling how to do whatever it is you need.
